## Wikiotics is a site for learning a foreign language.

Wikiotics hosts freely licensed, user-contributed lessons for the language acquisition community.  There are instruction materials for many languages, listed below.

## Everything is editable.

These lessons are currently editable through a graphical interface at https://old.wikiotics.org, but soon they will transition to being editable [on github](https://github.com/wikiotics/wikiotics.org).
